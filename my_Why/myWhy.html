  <h1>My Reasons and Vision for Entering Lambda School</h1>
  <h2>Past Discontent</h2>
  <p>Painting and teaching and learning, these have been my work and areas of attention and interest for the past decade.  But the difficulty and stress of trying to support myself through them drained my energy and also took away some of the joy I had and wanted to find in them.  I realized that even to continue making art and sharing though teaching, I needed financial security.  So I wondered what kind of work I could do that would be suitable, engaging, and actually provide income so I did not have to continue living below poverty level, struggling to pay minimal rent.</p>
  <h2>Present Hope</h2>
  <p>As I learned more about Lambda School I see more of a vision, more of what the changes are that I am seeking, more of what I can hope for. I already, in the pre-course work and launch week, see and feel my self and my life differently...and I desire to continue and deepen these positive changes.  In order to do well in the program I am attending more to my schedule, the use of my time, regular sleep hours, healthy eating. I see the training, effort, community, problem solving, growth mindset, and new career, all helping me become a better man.</p>
  <h2>Future Vision</h2>
  <p>I look forward with joy to improving my self and my situation in life.  I see a career as a web developer as one of intellectual engagement, creativity, and growth.  I hope to surround myself with dedicated, motivated people, people who are focused on growing and succeeding and helping one another succeed.  I am grateful for this opportunity, and I intend to do my best and use the supports that are available to succeed.</p>
